# Umbraco MCP Server - Project Context

## Project Overview

This is an **MCP (Model Context Protocol) server** that provides AI assistants with access to **Umbraco CMS Management API**. It allows AI tools to perform back office tasks like content management, user administration, and system configuration through standardized MCP interfaces.

## Architecture

- **MCP Server**: Exposes Umbraco Management API as MCP tools and resources
- **Authentication**: Uses Umbraco API users with configurable permissions
- **API Coverage**: Comprehensive tool coverage for all major Umbraco Management API endpoints
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation with Zod schema validation

## Project Maturity

This is a **well-established, production-ready codebase** with:
- ✅ Comprehensive testing patterns established
- ✅ Strong TypeScript typing throughout
- ✅ Established code conventions and helpers
- ✅ Builder pattern for test data creation
- ✅ Snapshot testing with normalization helpers
- ✅ RESTful tool organization by entity type

## Current State

- **100+ MCP tools** covering the full Umbraco Management API surface
- **Established testing standards** with builders and helpers
- **Consistent patterns** for tool creation, validation, and error handling
- **Mature codebase** - prioritize consistency with existing patterns over innovation

## Key Project Files

- **`./docs/comments.md`** - Documents API quirks, known issues, and limitations discovered during development
- **`./docs/crd.md`** - Content requirements and specifications for new features
- **`README.md`** - Complete tool documentation and setup instructions

When working on this project, always refer to existing implementations as the gold standard and maintain consistency with established patterns.
